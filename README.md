# City of Cape Town - Data Science Unit Code Challenge
** please note I added this file to give feedback on which scripts to run, when and for what purpose
I renamed the original README.md as CREADME.md

# Purpose
Give feedback on the analysis and code I've produced for the challenge

# Setup
This project is built in python3.9 with a virtual environment.
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Fetch data
We won't load file into github. I built a script to pull the data from the url and populate the directories as needed.
```sh
python rudivanwyk_fetch_data.py
```
